## Pet Project
### 1. Register
John wants to register for an account on the pet website. He navigates to the site, and clicks on register. He is greeted with a form where he has to type in his name, email address, password, phone number. Once he is done filling out the form, he clicks on "register" at the bottom. If any of the fields were not filled out, he gets a warning message. Finally, if he fills out everything correctly, John is taken the dashboard page. 

Story Points: 2

### 2.  Login
John wants to log in to his pre-existing account. He navigates to the site and clicks on login. He enters his username and password and clicks on "Login". If either of these credentials are incorrect, he receives a message telling him to fix these. Otherwise, he is redirected to his dashboard page and should see some of his information on the page.

Story Points: 1

### 3. Adopt
John wants to adopt a pet. He navigates to the adopt page and sees an extensive list of pets. He can filter the pets by species, name, age, location. When John sees a pet that he likes, he clicks on it to inspect it. The full display for the pet is brought up. John can then click on a button "adopt" to add this pet to his current adopted pets. 

John should not be able to adopt pets that are already adopted.

Story Points: 6

### 4. Viewing Adopted Pets
John wants to view the pets that he adopted. He first has to make sure he is logged in. He clicks on the profile button on the top right and then can scroll down to the section that shows all pets that he has adopted. He can click on these pets and view more information about them.

### Applying this to your project 2 groups:
- Take some time to meet with your groups
- Write up some user stories and assign story points
- Tentatively think about how you would break up the tasks between sprints. But keep in mind that it will probably be more back-end, then front-end , then deployment, rather than feature A, feature B, feature C
